# ADA_Project: Optimal Deterministic Massively Parallel Connectivity on Forests Implementation

Project Overview

This project aims to implement the algorithm proposed in the paper Optimal Deterministic Massively Parallel Connectivity on Forests. The goal is to identify connected components in massive graphs within the Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model. Since no official implementation is available, we will develop it manually using Python and Dask, with potential GPU acceleration for handling large datasets/graphs.

Current Status

The project is at the initial stage; no implementation has been completed yet.

We are setting up the development environment and reviewing the paper's theoretical foundations.

Planned Implementation

Programming Language: Python.

Libraries/Tools: Dask for parallelism, CuPy/RAPIDS for GPU acceleration (if needed).

Data: Synthetic datasets for testing and validation.

Approach: Implement the algorithm step-by-step following the theoretical descriptions in the paper.
